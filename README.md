## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about:

- Using css variables.
- Flexbox.
- CSS custom properties.
- CSS selectors (classes and id).

### Continued development

Given that this is the beginning, I am super stoked at what is ahead of me. I want to master CSS basics, intermediate, and advanced skills. I want to be able to focus on the subsequent projects to build my memory and creativity muscles that would make me an all-rounded full-stack SWE.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Cheat Sheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This helped me refresh my knowledge of CSS flexbox that came in handy in making the QR code component. I believe that I can achieve beautiful designs for different components of a website using CSS flexbox layout.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is an amazing website helped me countercheck the best practices such as line-height, image height, etc which helped me finally put together everything with the correct standard and in consideration of browsers. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning CSS.
